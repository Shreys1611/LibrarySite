# Library Management System Website

This repository contains the source code for a dynamic Library Management System website. The project was built as a comprehensive exercise in full-stack web development, utilizing PHP for server-side logic and a SQL database for data persistence.

The web application provides a functional interface for both librarians and users to manage a library's collection, track book loans, and handle user accounts.

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system for library members.
* **Book Catalog:** A searchable and viewable catalog of all books in the library's collection.
* **Borrow & Return System:** Functionality for users to borrow available books and for librarians to process returns.
* **Admin Panel:** A backend interface for librarians to add, update, or remove books and manage user accounts.
* **Database Integration:** All data, including book details, user information, and loan records, is stored and managed in a SQL database.
